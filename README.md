Telegram Bot fot Guides

### needs to be updated and further developed.


The bot was created for channels so that users could create guides in one bot and not pollute their channels with documentation. For this purpose you can create FAQ in the bot and publish it as a post with links. When clicking on the link, the user would get a convenient display of channel instructions with control buttons. 
1. Channels don't pollute content in channels/groups and keep guides in a single place. 
2. The user gets the whole guide on click and there is no need to search for instructions in channels. 

Almost finished making the bot and abandoned it due to lack of time :-(
